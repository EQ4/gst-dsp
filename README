Allo socket nodes should be in /lib/dsp

== vdec ==

You'll need these ringio.dll64P, usn.dll64P, and the corresponding
SN mp4vdec_sn.dll64P (MPEG-4 video), h264vdec_sn.dll64P (H.264).

== venc (and image) ==

You'll need usn.dll64P, and the corresponding SN JPEG (jpegenc_sn.dll64P).

== dummy ==

Make sure you have dummy.dll64P.

You can try putting dspdummy in the middle of normal gst-launch pipelines:
gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc ! dspdummy ! xvimagesink
