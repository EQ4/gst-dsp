== mp4vdec ==

You'll need ringio.dll64P, usn.dll64P, and mp4vdec_sn.dll64P in your /lib/dsp directory.

== dummy ==

Make sure you have /lib/dsp/dummy.dll64P in your rootfs.

You can try putting dspdummy in the middle of normal gst-launch pipelines:
gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc ! dspdummy ! xvimagesink
