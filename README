== vdec ==

You'll need these in /lib/dsp: ringio.dll64P, usn.dll64P, and the corresponding
SN mp4vdec_sn.dll64P (MPEG-4 video), h264vdec_sn.dll64P (H.264).

== dummy ==

Make sure you have /lib/dsp/dummy.dll64P in your rootfs.

You can try putting dspdummy in the middle of normal gst-launch pipelines:
gst-launch-0.10 videotestsrc ! dspdummy ! xvimagesink
